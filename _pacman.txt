Fright
------
The fright times in the Pac-Man Dossier are exact; there are no fractions of seconds involved.

When flashing: 14 frames to change from blue to white or vice versa, but white to normal may take less than 14 frames (9 frames on level 1, 6 on level 2).


LZSS
----
This can be used for both the maze and music patterns.

<furrykef> I just realized I don't need local OAM or the display list while decompressing LZSS, so one of them can double as the LZSS sliding window buffer.
<furrykef> So that saves 256 bytes of RAM.


Sound
-----
(preliminary and speculative)

00-7F   wait this number of frames plus one before proceeding
80-CF   notes
D0-EF   unused
F0-F2   set duty cycle (low nybble = which)
F3      set volume envelope (next word = address)
F4      set sweep (next byte = value to write to $4001/$4005)
F5-FC   unused
FD      note cut
FE      end of pattern
FF      end of song
